## Initial Thoughts
- Can take the csv file and process it using a loop to create a list of dictionaries which represent each of the data entries. Can use basic csv.DictReader() to achieve this.


## Running Script
- Open up a terminal and cd into this directory
- cd into main `cd main`
- run the script `python3 start.py`
